# 🚀 My Machine Learning Journey (From Scratch)

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Journey** repository!  
This repo documents my step-by-step learning of **Machine Learning from scratch**, focusing on **concept clarity, hands-on practice, and mini projects**.

I believe the best way to learn ML is by **building**, not just watching tutorials — so this repo grows as I grow.
